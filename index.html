         <p>I am currently a junior, one credti from being a senior, at Bob Jones University studying sports management with a minor in business administration. 
             I studied at Spartanburg Methodist College for my freshman and sophomore year, and I studied at Converse University my junior year. My fourth year is at BJU, but unfortunately I am still a junior.</p>
         <p>
            I enjoy working on cars, stream videogames, collect sneakers, and I also play soccer at the societies at BJU.
         </p> 
         <p>
            I plan on spending my last semesters at Bob Jones University becasue the atmosphere and enviornment are what make BJU such a great place, sort of.
